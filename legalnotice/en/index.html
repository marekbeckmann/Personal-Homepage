              <div class="text">
                The free and publicly accessible content on this website has been created with the utmost care. However,
                the provider of this website does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the provided free and
                publicly accessible journalistic advice and news. Contributions that are labeled with a name reflect the
                opinion of the respective author and not necessarily the opinion of the provider. Merely accessing the
                free and publicly accessible content does not create any contractual relationship between the user and
                the provider, as there is no intention of creating legal obligations on the part of the provider.

              <div class="text">
                This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are the
                responsibility of their respective operators. At the time of the initial linking of the external links,
                the provider checked the foreign content for any possible legal violations. No legal violations were
                apparent at that time. The provider has no influence on the current and future design and on the
                contents of the linked pages. The setting of external links does not mean that the provider adopts the
                content behind the reference or link as its own. Continuous monitoring of external links is not
                reasonable for the provider without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, upon becoming aware
                of legal violations, such external links will be deleted immediately.
